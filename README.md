# Machine_Translation

Overview

This repository contains a simplified example of building a machine translation model from English to Hindi using TensorFlow and Keras. 

The provided code includes data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and inference steps.

Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python
TensorFlow
scikit-learn (for data splitting)
Any other necessary libraries

Usage

Data Preparation:

Load and preprocess your English-Hindi translation dataset.
Tokenize the text and convert it into sequences.
Set input_vocab_size, output_vocab_size, max_input_length, and max_output_length according to your dataset.
Model Configuration:
Define the model architecture by specifying hyperparameters such as embedding_dim, hidden_units, batch_size, and epochs.
Customize the encoder and decoder models as needed.

Model Training:

Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
Split your dataset into training and validation sets.
Train the model by running model.fit with your training data.

Inference:

Implement the translate and decode_sequence functions for making translations.
Use the trained model to translate English sentences to Hindi.

Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using a separate test dataset or validation data.
Check the test loss and accuracy to assess the model's quality.
Customization:
Feel free to customize the code to suit your specific requirements.
Attention mechanisms for better translation quality.
